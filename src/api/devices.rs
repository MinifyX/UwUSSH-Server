//! Devices: list them, let one in, shut one out.

//! Joining is two secrets, not one. The **enrolment token** comes from a device
//! that is already in, through a channel this server cannot read — so the
//! server knows the join was approved. The **login key** comes from the master
//! password — so the server knows the person approving it is the owner. Either
//! one alone gets nowhere, which is what makes an intercepted pairing code
//! worthless.
