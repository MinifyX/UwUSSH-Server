//! How often somebody may try.
//!
//! Two kinds of counting. **Per address**, where guessing would pay: creating
//! an account, joining with an enrolment token, the pairing relay — and,
//! loosely, signing in, which is counted per device at an address as well
//! (see [`crate::api::session`]). And **per account or device**, where one account holder
//! could make the server work for nobody else: pushing and pulling, making
//! tokens, opening pairing sessions, and proving the master password, which is
//! a guess too when the one proving it is not the owner. Pushes and pulls are
//! also counted **at once**, per account: how many a minute says nothing about
//! how many are held in memory at the same time.
//!
//! The counters live in memory. A restart forgets them, which is the right
//! trade for a homelab server: the alternative is a write to disk for every
//! request, to slow down an attacker who would have to survive the restart
//! anyway.
